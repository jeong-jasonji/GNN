### Registry ###
Registry: a lightweight, type-safe global store that maps string keys to classes/functions.
    Multiple registries (MODEL_REGISTRY, DATASET_REGISTRY, etc.) for mapping.
    New components register via decorators.

Usage:
from core.registry import MODEL_REGISTRY

@MODEL_REGISTRY.register("lightcnn")
class LightCNN(tf.keras.Model):
    ...

now MODEL_REGISTRY.get("lightcnn") will return the lightcnn class

### Builder ###
Builder: a factory that reads a config (dict/YAML) and uses registries to instantiate objects automatically.

### Base Model ###
base_model: a template model with abstract methods to ensure implementation

	@abstractmethod:

	The method is declared, but not implemented in the base class.

	Any subclass that inherits from this class must override (i.e., 
	implement) that method, otherwise Python will raise an error if 
	you try to instantiate the subclass.

	Subclasses must implement all abstract methods to be instantiable.
	Used to define interfaces or base class contracts. Enforcing those 
	subclasses follow a certain structure.

### Base Dataset ###
base_dataset: a template dataset with abstract methods to ensure implementation

### Base Trainer ###
base_trainer: a template trainer that has the following:
	A unified pipeline → reads YAML → builds model/dataset/loss/opt from registry.
	Also handles reproducibility and checkpointing automatically.

### Utils ###
utility functions for reproducibility and etc.
