models notes:

### Backbones ###
backbone architectures to base models off of.

Specific models can be registered so that we can plug
and play any previous models.

### Model Components ###
reusable building blocks for modular model building
also allows custom blocks to be designed for future use/more modularity.

### Builders ###
builds the model according to the design file

### Self Supervised ###
support for self supervised learning methods

### Pre-init encoders ###
encoder.load_weights("experiments/runs/supcon_defects/best_model.h5")
