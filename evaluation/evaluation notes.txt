evaluation notes

### Sanity Checks ###
- Quick diagnostic to check model stability and training correctness.
- Helps debug architecture, gradients, and data flow early.

### Generic ### 
generic checks on graidents and fitting check

### anomaly and ssl checks ###
checks that modules behave the way we expect it to

Use tensorboard: 

tensorboard --logdir experiments/runs/lightcnn_design_test/logs

ssl/inter_class_distance
ssl/intra_class_distance
anomaly/reconstruction_loss
ssl/embedding_tsne
anomaly/reconstruction_examples
